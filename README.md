## General info
The Transformers Community is the community that comes together to fix the generation of the people with mental health issues.  

We created this project with the intent of solving a problem.  
The problem where people with mental health issues didn't have anyone to talk to when they were feeling down.

The way we solved this problem is by using post feature within the the website to bring the people with mental health issues together to form a connection.
With that connection, we made sure that the people struggling with mental health issues got somewhere to go. 
So this can make everyones life better.
